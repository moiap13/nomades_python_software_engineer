    ********************************************************************************************************************
    The main idea is to store the position of each segment on the screen in a list (body).
    When drawing the snake we will draw a rectangle for each segment of the snake given the position.

    To make the snake move, we will add a new segment at the head of the snake and remove the last segment of the snake.
    The new head segment is a copy of the current head segment with the new position.
    The new position is defined by the current direction of the snake. look at the move() function for more details.

    To change the direction of the snake, we will use the change_direction() function. The new direction is passed as an argument.
    The new direction is valid if and only if it's not the opposite of the current direction.

    To grow the snake, we will add a new segment at the end of the snake.
    This new segment will be deleted when the move function will be called

    Then we will check if the snake hits the border of the screen or if the snake hits itself.
    This will be done using the position of the head. (the first segment of the snake)
    if the head is at the same position of one of the segments of the snake, the snake hits itself.
    if the head is outside the screen, the snake hits the border of the screen.

    To eat the food, we will check if the head of the snake is at the same position as the food. using the check_collision() function.

    The game is over if the snake hits the border of the screen or if the snake hits itself.
