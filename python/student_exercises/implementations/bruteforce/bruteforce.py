"""
This is a hashed password that is generated using the SHA-256 algorithm.
You task is to find the password that was used to generate this hash.
For that you need to know some information about the password:
- It is an alphabetical string
- It is a lower case string
- It is a 5 letter string

The password to be found is hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm.
The SHA-256 algorithm is a hashing algorithm that takes a string as input and generates a 256 bit (32 byte) hash as output.
The hash is a hexadecimal string that is 64 characters long.
You can use the hashlib library to generate the hash of a string.
example:
    ```python
    password = hashlib.sha256("MyCurrentPassword".encode()).hexdigest()
    ```

Knowing that information, 
you can write a program that will generate all possible combinations of 5 letter strings. and try to break the password.

Questions Part
1. What is the time complexity of the brute force algorithm?


2. What would be the time complexity if the password was 6 characters long instead of 5?


3. What would be the value of MAX_ITER if the password contains uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits and special characters?


4. Imagine you have a computer that clock a 4GHZ (4 billion cycles per second). 
  Complete the table below with the time taken to break the password for different lengths of passwords.
  ```
  | population/length | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 |
  |-------------------|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|
  | lower_case (26)   | | | | | | | | | | |
  | upper_case (26)   | | | | | | | | | | |
  | digits (10)       | | | | | | | | | | |
  | special (32)      | | | | | | | | | | |
  | alpha_lower_upper (52) | | | | | | | | | | |
